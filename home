        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a freshman at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, majoring in pre-business with plans to double major
            in finance and real estate.
            <br>
            Born and raised in Wisconsin, my family of four includes my father Scott, mother Jan, and older brother
            Brett.
            We've lived in the same house our entire lives and enjoy participating in activities together.
            <br>
            While we are big Wisconsin sports fans, supporting the Milwaukee Bucks and Green Bay Packers, I also
            cherish exploring new things and embracing the unknown factors that life presents.
            <br>
            Despite our similarities, our unique differences contribute to shaping who I am today.

        <h2>Hobbies: Sports</h2>
        <p>
            In high school, I was passionate about sports and tried my hand at various activities, including basketball,
            soccer, football, pole vaulting, diving, volleyball, and golf.

        <h2>Friends</h2>
        <p>
            I have friends back home, and since being in Madison, I've met new people and formed close connections. My
            friends back home, a group of 20 of us, have been together since freshman year of high school. We share
            incredible memories and have experienced each other's best and worst days.
            <br>
            In Madison, I've connected with around 15 guys who share the same interests and activities. My friends are
            vital to me; they are the ones I rely on and can talk to about anything for hours.
        </p>
