    <h2>Friends</h2>

    <p>
        I have friends back home and have met new friends here in Madison, providing me with many old and new
        friends. My friends back home are very close because we have grown up together and experienced each
        other's worst and best days. We have 20 of us and have been in the same group together since freshman
        year of high school.
        <br>
        After being in Madison for a few months so far, I have met new people and got to know new people. I am
        close with roughly 15 guys who share the same interests and partake in the same activities. My friends are
        very important to me because they are the ones that I rely on and can talk to about anything for hours.
