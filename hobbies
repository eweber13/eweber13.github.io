    <h3>Sports</h3>
    <p>
        In high school, I was passionate about sports and tried my hand at various activities, including basketball,
        soccer, football, pole vaulting, diving, volleyball, and golf.

    <h3>Water Activities</h3>
    <p>
        Whenever summer comes around, it is always the best time of the year for me because my family always heads
        to the lake to jet ski and boat. There is a place in Marco Island, Florida, that has a jet ski tour where
        they take you through the Everglades.
        <br>

    <h3>Poker</h3>
    <p>
        Over the recent months, my friends and I have been in a huge poker phase, playing weekly.
