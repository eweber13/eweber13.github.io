        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a freshman at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, majoring in pre-business with plans to double major
            in finance and real estate.
            <br>
            Born and raised in Wisconsin, my family of four includes my father Scott, mother Jan, and older brother
            Brett.
            We've lived in the same house our entire lives and enjoy participating in activities together.
            <br>
            While we are big Wisconsin sports fans, supporting the Milwaukee Bucks and Green Bay Packers, I also
            cherish exploring new things and embracing the unknown factors that life presents.
            <br>
            Despite our similarities, our unique differences contribute to shaping who I am today.
